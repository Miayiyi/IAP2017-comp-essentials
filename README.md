# Computing Essentials for Scientists and Engineers



## Session 1 - Files, Programs and Directories

Content: 

- Information storage. ASCII, dat files, etc. 
- Source code, machine code, and in between. 
- File types. Everything is binary, it just depends how you use/interpret it. 
- The PATH environment variable. 
- Calling executables from the terminal/command line. NO SPACES IN YOUR DIRECTORIES PLEASE!

Learning Outcomes:

- Understand the common basis of all files and that interpretation is contextual. 
- Know the directory structure of your OS
- Not rely/be overly dependent on shortcuts and know where your programs are.  
- Feel comfortable dealing with all file types and place less importance on file extensions.
- Keep a clean logical workflow.  
- Understand why program installers exist and why you usually don't just download the final program.
- Know what is happening when you are looking at a 'corrupt' (not actually corrupt) file.

## Session 2 - Programming Languages and Important Selections

Content: 

- What is a programming language? 
- Compiled vs Interpreted. Common misconceptions.  
- Low level - C
- High level - Python/Matlab
- Multiplatform development - Java
- Relational Databases - SQL

Learning Outcomes:

- Know what actually happens when a programming language is said to be compiled or interpreted.
- Understand the context of low and high level languages. 
- Understand the importance of relational databases.

## Session 3 - Version Control and Collaboration

Content:

- Importance of version control and collaborative softwave development
- Tracking changes using Git
	- The git workflow
	- Initializing git repository
	- Staging 
	- Branches
	- Merges and conflicts
- Collaborative development using GitHub
	- Remotes
	- Cloning
	- Pulling - Fetch + Merge
	- Pushing
	- Remote Branches

Learning Outcomes:

- Understand that modern software development is collaborative and built upon the work of others. 
- Understand the importance of version control and feel comfortable with basic git commands. 
- Want to use git and Github for your future projects.


## Session 4 - Ergonomics and economics of modern computing

Content: 

- Cloud computing and SAAS.
- AI and Neural networks 
- CPUs and GPUs/parallel computing.
- Security and encryption - RSA 
- Operating systems. Differences and a brief history. 


Learning Outcomes:

- Understand what doing/storing things 'on the cloud' means.
- Understand the significance of AI, SAAS, and deep learning to the future of software.
- Choose computers, operating systems, and software to suit one's own needs.
