# Computing Essentials for Scientists and Engineers



## Session 1 - Files, Programs and Directories

Understand how information is stored, the difference between code. 

Answer these questions:
- Why do program installers exist? Why can't we just directly download the final program?
- Know the directory structure of your OS
- Know what is happening when you are looking at a 'corrupt' (not actually corrupt) file.
- Not rely/be overly dependent on shortcuts and know where all your programs are.  



the following:

- Information storage. ASCII, dat files, etc. 
- Source code, machine code, and in between. 
- File types. Everything is binary, it just depends how you use/interpret it. 
- The PATH environment variable. 
- Calling executables from the terminal/command line


## Session 2 - Important Programming Languages

- Compiled vs Interpreted 
- Relational Databases - SQL
- Low level - C
- High level - Python/Matlab
- Multiplatform development - Java


## Session 3 - Version Control 

- Importance of version control 
- Tracking changes using Git
	- 
- Collaborative development using GitHub
	- Remotes
	- Cloning
	- Pulling
	- Pushing
	- Remote Branches
